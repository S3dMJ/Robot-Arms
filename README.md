# Robot-Arms
In this task, we used six servo motors to move the robot arms. And, we set the starting rotation point for all motors as 0 degrees. And we made three positions for the motors to be at with a one-second delay between each position. By using a while loop, the arms of the robot will go to all positions and then repeats the cycle.
